## üñåÔ∏è SmartCommerce UI/UX Design Plan

### üî• Project Overview

SmartCommerce is a modern, clean, and scalable e-commerce platform for both digital and physical products. The UI should be responsive, accessible, user-friendly, and role-based (Admin, Seller, Customer, Guest). Consistency, simplicity, and clarity are the core principles.
